This file describes the preliminary C++11 model in Herd.

The model can be found in cpp11.cat. The syntax is quite close
to OCaml. If you use emacs, see the README file for some instructions
you can put into your .emacs file to improve the syntax
highlighting.

For a description of Herd, see the paper at:

Examples

Some examples (mostly based around the MP litmus test) can be found
in testsuite/CPP11Tests.

to run the examples do:

./herd -model cpp11.cat example.litmus

to produce a .dot output, add the flags:

-o <directory to place .dot file> -show prop -web

In examples with data races, you may change the line in cpp11.cat from
"empty dr"
to
"show dr"

then examples with data races are allowed, and the racing events
are shown in the .dot output.

Here are the examples described:

MP_relaxed.litmus - Performs MP with relaxed atomics, all outcomes
                    are observable

MP_dr.litmus - Same as MP_relaxed.litmus with first store and last load
               changed to non-atomics so that they race. No executions
	       are allowed because they all contain a data race.

MP_relacq.litmus - Same as MP_dr.litmus with atomics turned to release acquire. 
		 The only execution that doesn't contain a data-race is 
		 when both loads return 1.

MP_relseq.litmus - Same as MP_relacq.litmus but with a release sequence. 
                   In this example, the dot output shows the appropriate 
		   sw edge even when the load reads from a store in the release
		   sequence.
