C11 model in Herd, proved (in HOL) equivalent to Batty's Lem formalisation. Slight discrepancy with the ../popl2016 model: this model forgets to intersect "co" with "atomic_loc", which means that modification order passes through writes to atomic and non-atomic locations. The HOL proof is correct; it just makes a wrong assumption about the properties of "co" that Herd natively provides.
