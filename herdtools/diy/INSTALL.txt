* Requirements

   You need Objective Caml, with a version as recent as 3.12.0.
   Ocaml is available from http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

* Configuration
  A single variable (PREFIX) in the Makefile commands where
  the software get installed:

  - The binaires will get installed in $(PREFIX)/bin
  - Some files are installed in  $(PREFIX)/lib/litmus

  If the default (PREFIX=/usr/local) does not fit, edit the Makefile.

* Compilation/installation :

Just type

  % make all
  % make install (you may have to gain root privilege for this step)

This will install binaries herd, litmus, diy, diyone, diycross,
and some other tools in $(PREFIX)/bin; and some files in
$(PREFIX)/lib/herd  and $(PREFIX)/lib/litmus.
  
You can now get rid of the sources.
